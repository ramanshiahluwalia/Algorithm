# Implementation of Insertion Sort Algorithm in C
Sorting is one of the most fundamental problems in computer science. There are many sorting algorithms available, and Insertion sort is one of them. It is an efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements.

The code begins with the declaration of an integer array of size 5. It then prints the available array and calls the InsertionSort function to sort the given array. Finally, it prints the sorted array using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

The InsertionSort function takes two parameters, an integer array and its size, and sorts the array using the Insertion Sort algorithm.







## Explanations

The Insertion Sort algorithm works by iterating over the elements of the array and assuming the first element to be in a sorted array. It then picks the next element and inserts it into the correct position in the sorted array. The algorithm repeats this process until all elements are sorted.

The InsertionSort function starts by assuming the first element of the array to be in the sorted array. It then iterates over the remaining elements of the array, picks an element, and inserts it into the correct position in the sorted array. The function repeats this process until all elements are sorted.

Sample

## Sample output
````
Available array:
6 70 20 67 90
````
````
Sorted array (Insertion Sort):
6 20 67 70 90
````

## Usage
The Insertion Sort algorithm can be used for sorting a small number of elements. It is useful when the number of elements to be sorted is less than 10^5. The algorithm can be used in various applications such as sorting data in a database or sorting numbers in a game.
